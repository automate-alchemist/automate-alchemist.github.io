          <ul>
            <li><b>Learning:</b> Learned how to generate detailed test reports in pytest.</li>
            <li><b>Description:</b> I explored generating reports using pytest's built-in features and plugins. This is essential for tracking the results of automated UI tests, especially when running large test suites.</li>
            <li><b>Key Takeaway:</b> Having test reports that detail pass/fail statuses, along with error traces, makes debugging and tracking test progress much easier. It helps in maintaining transparency within the team.</li>
            <li><b>Personal Reflection:</b> I've come to realize that reporting is just as important as running the tests themselves. It's a great way to communicate results clearly to stakeholders.</li>
